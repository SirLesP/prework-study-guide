# Prework Study Guide Webpage
 
## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

To undertake the prework section ahead of the start of the main course, finding out the level we are starting at and preparing for classes and collaborations with other students.

Going through the process covered both mental preparation and the installation of software that will be used during the course.

The most important thing for me was to start to use git and github, vital for version control when co-operating on projects, especially using agile development methods.
